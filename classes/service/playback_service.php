 * Public chokepoint for playback-token minting.

 * this service to obtain a JWT — direct use of jwt_signing_service
 * is a PR-3 violation (consumer contract CC1).
 *
 * Read-path. No gateway call (rule W7), no DB write. The asset is
 * looked up via asset_service::get_by_fastpix_id which is MUC-cached;
 * the JWT mint itself is 1–5ms and never cached (rule S10).
