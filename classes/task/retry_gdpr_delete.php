/**
 * Scheduled task: retry FastPix-side deletion for soft-deleted assets where
 * the remote delete previously failed.
 *
 * Per architecture doc §16: local soft-delete is immediate; remote delete is
 * best-effort. When the remote call fails, gdpr_delete_pending_at is set
 * and this task retries on cron, incrementing gdpr_delete_attempts each
 * time. After MAX_ATTEMPTS the row stops being selected — a row stuck at
 * the cap signals a degraded state that ops must investigate; the local
 * soft-delete is still in effect, so users see no leakage.
 *
 * Per @tasks-cleanup guardrails: batched, time-boxed, idempotent, never
 * logs raw user IDs.
