/**
 * Daily hard-purge of assets that have been soft-deleted for ≥ 7 days
 * (rule W10).
 * Soft-delete is the user-facing action: `asset_service::soft_delete()`
 * stamps `deleted_at` on the row and invalidates the asset cache. After
 * a 7-day grace window the row is hard-deleted by this task — caption
 * rows in `local_fastpix_track` are removed in the same loop because
 * the FK is declared without ON DELETE CASCADE.
 * Distinct from `asset_cleanup`, which handles a different lifecycle:
 * GDPR-pending rows where the local delete succeeded but the FastPix
 * delete failed (gdpr_delete_pending_at).
